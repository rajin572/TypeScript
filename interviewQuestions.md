<p>
<b>Question 1:</b> Can you explain the difference between "interface" and "type" in TypeScript?
</p>
<p>
<b>Ans :</b> In TypeScript, both "interface" and "type" are used to define object types and describe the shape of data. They have similar functionality, but they have some differences in syntax and use case. <br/>

Interfaces are often used to describe the shape of objects and define contracts for classes or functions. They are commonly used in object-oriented programming. <br/>

Types are often used to define aliases for complex types or to combine types together. They are commonly used in functional programming.
