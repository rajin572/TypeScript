--------------------------Type Assertion------------------------

Type Assertion: Type assertion is a Typescript technique that tells the compiler the variable type. Type assertion allows you to set the type of a value and tell the compiler not to infer it. This is when you, as a programmer, might have a better understanding of the type of a variable than what TypeScript can infer on its own.
